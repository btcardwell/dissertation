\chapter{Poorly measured lepton \ad at large $|\eta|$}
\label{large_eta}

We require muons to have $|\eta|<1.5$ due to the observed increase in width of the muon $d_0$ distribution at large $|\eta|$ in Drell-Yan simulation with \ztautaull events removed (see Fig.~\ref{large_eta_mu} (left)). The width visibly increases at large $|\eta|$ in all three years but is less pronounced in 2017 and 2018 due to the improved performance of the Phase-1 pixel detector. The upgraded pixel detector is also responsible for the overall difference in $d_0$ width between years. Requiring muon $|\eta|< 1.5$ has two effects: (1) it dramatically reduces the mismeasurement background in 2016 data in the $\Pgm\Pgm$ channel, and (2) it removes a possible source of \ada-\adb correlation in which the correlation between muons in $\eta$ leads to correlation between muons in \ad. As shown in Fig.~\ref{large_eta_mu} (right), muons from \stoptolb events tend to have small $|\eta|$, so requiring muon $|\eta|< 1.5$ has a minimal effect on the signal acceptance.

Electron $d_0$ resolution also worsens at large $|\eta|$. Furthermore, Fig.~\ref{large_eta_e} (left) shows that electrons from SM mesons are particularly concentrated $|\eta|>1.5$. As in the muon case, electrons from \stoptolb events tend to have $|\eta|<1.5$ (see Fig.~\ref{large_eta_e}), which implies that requiring electron $|\eta|<1.5$ will reduce the mismeasurement and SM meson backgrounds without significantly reducing signal acceptance.
