\caption{Left: The standard deviation of the leading muon $d_0$ as a function of the leading muon $\eta$ for simulated background events. To ensure that the variation in width is purely due to $d_0$ resolution effects, we use a sample of simulated DY events from which the \ztautaull events have been removed. Right: Muon $\eta$ distribution for simulated \stoptolb events. The $\Pgm\Pgm$ preselection with a loosened $|\eta|$ requirement is applied in both plots.}
