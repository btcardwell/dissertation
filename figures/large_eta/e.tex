\caption{Left: electron $\eta$ distribution for simulated background events in which the electron parent particles are required to be SM mesons. Right: Electron $\eta$ distribution for simulated \stoptolb events. The $\Pe\Pgm$ preselection with a loosened $\eta$ requirement is applied in both plots.}
