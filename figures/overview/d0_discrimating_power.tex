\caption{Distribution of data (colors) and simulated Displaced SUSY events (black boxes) in the plane defined by electron \ad and muon \ad. The size of the black boxes are proportional to the bin content, and the bins along the x and y axes include underflow. All events are required to pass the $\Pe\Pgm$ preselection defined in Section~\ref{selection}.}
