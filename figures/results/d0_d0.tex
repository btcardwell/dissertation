Two-dimensional distributions of \ada and \adb, for the events in data that pass the $\Pe\Pgm$ (left), $\Pe\Pe$ (middle), and $\Pgm\Pgm$ (right) preselection. The bins along the x and y axes contain underflow. The inclusive signal region covers the region between \SI{100}{\um} and \SI{10}{\cm} in each \ad variable shown.
