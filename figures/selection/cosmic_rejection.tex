\caption{The di-muon $\cos{(\alpha)}$ distribution of 2018 \texttt{NoBPTX} data and simulated \stoptolb events (left) and the di-muon $\Delta t$ distribution in simulated cosmic-ray muon events in 2016 conditions (center) and \stoptolb (right) events in 2018 conditions. In each case, all \Pgm\Pgm\ preselection criteria except those relating to cosmic rejection are applied.}
