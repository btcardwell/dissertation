\caption{The cumulative number of simulated \stoptolb events that pass each criterion in the 2018 $\Pe\Pgm$ (top), $\Pe\Pe$ (middle), and $\Pgm\Pgm$ (bottom) preselection. Several $\PSQt$ proper decay lengths are shown. The jet criteria do not exclude any events and are simply an artifact of the analysis framework.}
