\caption{The cumulative number of events that pass each criterion in the $\Pe\Pgm$ (upper), $\Pe\Pe$ (middle), and $\Pgm\Pgm$ (lower) preselection, using 2018 signal simulation. Several $\PSQt$ proper decay lengths are shown. The jet criteria do not exclude any events and are simply an artifact of the analysis framework.}
