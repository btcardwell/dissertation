\caption{The electron (left) and muon (right) \ad distributions for 2018 simulation events that pass the $\Pe\Pgm$ preselection criteria. The upper two plots show \stoptolb simulation for a single $\PSQt$ mass and four different proper decay lengths; each histogram is normalized to unity. The lower two plots show the background simulation normalized to the integrated luminosity. In all of the histograms, the last bin includes the overflow. All of the corrections from Section~\ref{corrections} are applied.}
