\caption{The observed local p-value for the five decay modes and the overall combination as a function of the SM Higgs boson mass showing the importance of the ECAL mass resolution in the discovery of the Higgs boson by the CMS experiment. The dashed line shows the expected local p-values for a SM Higgs boson with a mass $m_{H}$ \cite{cms_higgs}.}
