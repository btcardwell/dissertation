\caption{The fraction of electrons (left) and muons (right) from different parents as a function of lepton \ad, for simulated \ttbar events that pass the 2018 $\Pe\Pgm$ channel preselection. In \ttbar events, the vast majority of leptons whose parent is a $\PW$ boson are produced in a prompt decay.}
