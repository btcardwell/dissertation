\caption{The di-muon invariant mass distribution in data events that pass the 2018 $\Pgm\Pgm$ prompt control region (black), SR I (blue), and SR IV (red) criteria with the muon isolation and di-muon $\DR$ criteria inverted. The equivalent distribution in the prompt control region is also shown in green.}
