\chapter{Search for displaced leptons}
\label{displaced_leptons}
In this chapter, I present a search for new long-lived particles (LLPs) that could be produced in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of \SI{13}{\TeV} at the LHC and detected by the CMS experiment. The search targets the unique signature of ``displaced leptons" that could be produced when LLPs decay to leptons after propagating a measurable distance from the location of the proton-proton collision. The candidate signal events include at least two leptons (one electron and one muon, two electrons, or two muons) whose transverse impact parameters are between \num{0.01} and \SI{10}{\cm}. Choosing transverse impact parameter as the main discriminating variable allows us to target pairs of displaced leptons without requiring that they form a common vertex. We apply an otherwise minimal event selection to retain sensitivity to a wide range of new physics models.

The Ohio State CMS group has previously performed two related searches for displaced leptons in the electron-muon final state: one in \SI{19.7}{\invfb} of \SI{8}{\TeV} data and another in \SI{2.6}{\invfb} of \SI{13}{\TeV} data~\cite{displaced_leptons_run1, displaced_leptons_bing}. The search presented here is the most sensitive to date. Some of the most significant improvements include:
\begin{itemize}
    \itemsep0em
    \item adding sensitivity to the electron-electron and muon-muon final states
    \item simplifying the event selection to reduce model dependence
    \item introducing a custom lepton isolation definition to significantly reduce the background from heavy-flavor meson decays
    \item implementing a new, fully data-driven background estimation procedure
    \item expanding the signal region to include leptons with smaller transverse impact parameters
    \item adding a second signal interpretation
    \item analyzing more than a factor of \num{40} times more data than the previous \SI{13}{\TeV} analysis~\cite{displaced_leptons_bing}
\end{itemize}

The ATLAS collaboration has also recently submitted a paper in which they target displaced leptons with transverse impact parameters between \num{0.3} and \SI{30}{\cm}. They observe no significant excess and set upper limits on the production cross section of long-lived sleptons in a gravity-mediated SUSY breaking model~\cite{atlas_displaced_leptons}.

The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows: Section~\ref{overview} introduces the displaced leptons experimental signature in the context of LLPs at the LHC and gives an overview of the analysis strategy, Section~\ref{samples} defines the data and simulated SM and signal samples used in the analysis, Section~\ref{selection} describes the event selection criteria and defines the signal and control regions, Section~\ref{corrections} describes the various corrections applied to the SM and signal simulation, Section~\ref{bg} investigates the sources of background and defines the procedure for estimating their contribution to the signal region, Section~\ref{systematics} describes the sources of systematic uncertainty in the efficiency for simulated signal events to pass the signal region selection, and Section~\ref{results} presents the results.
