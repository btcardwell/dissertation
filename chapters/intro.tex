\chapter{Introduction}
\label{intro}
Particle physicists seek to understand the fundamental constituents of nature and their interactions. At the present moment, the Standard Model of particle physics (along with the general theory of relativity) represents the most complete understanding humanity has yet achieved. At the same time, the Standard Model cannot explain gravity or several observed but not yet understood aspects of nature and therefore must give way to a more complete theory at a higher energy scale. One approach to understanding what might be hiding beneath the Standard Model is to use high-energy particle collisions to probe nature at ever smaller length scales. This thesis presents a search for beyond the Standard Model physics in \SI{13}{\TeV} proton-proton collision data collected by the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, which is the highest-energy particle collider ever constructed.

The search presented in this thesis targets new long-lived particles that produce displaced leptons, a unique signature that could evade many existing searches for new physics. In this chapter, I present theoretical context in the form of a brief overview of the Standard Model and targeted discussion of beyond the Standard Model physics and long-lived particles. I then present the experimental context with an overview of the Large Hadron Collider and the Compact Muon Solenoid detector in Chapter~\ref{lhc_and_cms}, present the search itself in Chapter~\ref{displaced_leptons}, and conclude in Chapter~\ref{conclusion}.
