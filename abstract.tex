A search is presented for new long-lived particles that propagate a measurable distance through the CMS detector before decaying to leptons. The search is performed in 113--\SI{118}{\invfb} of proton-proton collision data produced by the CERN LHC at a center-of-mass energy of \SI{13}{\TeV} and collected by the CMS detector in 2016, 2017, and 2018. Events are selected with two leptons (an electron and a muon, two electrons, or two muons) that both have transverse impact parameter values between \SI{0.01}{\cm} and \SI{10}{\cm}. Using transverse impact parameter as the discriminating variable allows for sensitivity to displaced decays without requiring that the leptons form a common vertex. The search is designed to be sensitive to a wide range of new physics models that produce displaced di-lepton final states. The observation is consistent with the background-only hypothesis, and limits are set on the product of the cross-section of top squark pair production and the branching fraction to a lepton and a \cPqb\ or \cPqd\ quark through an R-parity-violating vertex. For a proper decay length hypothesis of \SI{2}{\cm}, top squarks with masses up \SI{1500}{\GeV} are excluded at the \SI{95}{\percent} confidence level.\fxnote{switch to range?}
